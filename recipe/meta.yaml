# About git-lfs:  There are files stored in LFS in the
# tracktable-docs and tracktable-data repositories.  These
# are included as submodules of of Tracktable.
#
# It is likely that we only need git-lfs in the host environment,
# if that, but since I'm chasing a bug in conda-build I don't
# yet know for sure.

  build:

    # try adding git-lfs to either the the build or host section to make
    # the LFS error go away.
    # maybe both?  just for good measure?

  summary: 'Trajectory Analysis and Rendering'
  description: >
    Tracktable is for analyzing trajectories from moving objects.  It
    provides modules to read in points/trajectories, assemble trajectories
    from points, compute features and feature vectors for trajectories,
    run DBSCAN clustering, search for similar trajectories, and render
    the results in static or dynamic maps.
